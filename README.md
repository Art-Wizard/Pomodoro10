# Pomodoro10

Pomodoro10 is a productivity app based on the Pomodoro Technique, with added random 10-second breaks during each Pomodoro period to help improve learning efficiency by addressing the primacy and recency effects. The app is build on [Solar2d game engine](https://github.com/solar2d/Solar2D.com) 

## Features

- Standard 25-minute Pomodoro work intervals
- 5-minute breaks between work intervals
- 1-3 random 10-second breaks during each work interval
- Configurable settings for customizing work intervals and break durations

## How it works

The Pomodoro Technique involves breaking work into focused 25-minute intervals, followed by short 5-minute breaks. Pomodoro10 builds on this concept by introducing 1-3 random 10-second breaks within each 25-minute work interval.

These additional breaks are designed to combat the primacy and recency effects, which are cognitive biases in learning and memory. The primacy effect refers to the tendency to remember items presented at the beginning of a list or learning session better, while the recency effect refers to the tendency to remember items at the end of a list or session more easily. As a result, items in the middle of a learning session are often less well-remembered.

Pomodoro10 addresses these biases by disrupting the traditional flow of learning with short, random breaks. These breaks create additional starting and ending points within each Pomodoro period, providing more opportunities to benefit from both the primacy and recency effects. This leads to enhanced memory retention and improved learning efficiency.

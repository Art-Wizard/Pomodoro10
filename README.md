###POMODORO10

##A learning pomodoro timer with random two to three 10 second intervals for achieving the gap effect in your learning.

#HOW TO USE

Start the timer, and start learning. When the program chimes in the middle of the timer running, close your eyes and take a 10 second break. The timer will chime when this mini break has ended.
This will happen two to three times.


#KNOWN ISSUES
Cannot be left on the background on android, instantly stops counting the timer if not the main focus app. I do not know yet how to fix this.

# Pomodoro10

Pomodoro10 is a productivity app based on the Pomodoro Technique, with added random 10-second breaks during each Pomodoro period to help improve learning efficiency by leveraging the gap effect. 

Pomodoro10 is build on [Solar2d game engine](https://github.com/solar2d/Solar2D.com).
 
## Features

- Standard 25-minute Pomodoro work intervals
- 5-minute breaks between work intervals
- 1-3 random 10-second breaks during each work interval
- Configurable settings for customizing work intervals and break durations

## How it works

The Pomodoro Technique involves breaking work into focused 25-minute intervals, followed by short 5-minute breaks. Pomodoro10 builds on this concept by introducing 1-3 random 10-second breaks within each 25-minute work interval.

These additional breaks take advantage of the gap effect, which suggests that brief pauses or "micro rests" during study sessions can enhance learning and memory retention. The gap effect allows the brain to consolidate information more effectively, leading to a more efficient learning process.

Pomodoro10 integrates these micro rests by disrupting the traditional flow of learning with short, random breaks. These breaks create additional opportunities for the brain to process and store information, resulting in improved learning efficiency.
